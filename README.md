# RPi HTTP Actuator for OpenPNP

this is a simple HTTP web server to be used inside the OpenPNP as a HTTP Actuator.
The purpose is to read pressure values and control the Vacuum level with one output, where
my pump is connected. The other outputs can be used to control other binary actuators
e.g. the light of my camera or valves on my pnp head.
